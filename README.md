## Description

This repository includes a Docker Compose setup for quickly launching a WordPress instance with a MariaDB database. It simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining a WordPress site with an underlying database.

Key features:

- **Containerized Deployment**: Run WordPress and MariaDB reliably using Docker.
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Easily customize credentials and database details via a `.env` file.
- **Scalable & Portable**: Run locally or deploy on a remote server/VM.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Docker Compose was included with Docker versions 20.10 and later, but recently it is no longer included by default. For the latest Docker versions, you will need to install Docker Compose manually as a plugin. Follow the official instructions for detailed steps.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PascalNehlsen/wordpress-container
   cd wordpress-container
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file from the example configuration:

   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file to set your desired configuration (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

4. Start the WordPress and MariaDB containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Access your WordPress site:

   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or your server's IP if running remotely).
   - Now you can configure the Admin panel.

6. To stop the server, use:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## Usage
